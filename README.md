# ðŸŽ¶ Boss Fight Music (BFM) - *Work In Progress*

---

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

**Boss Fight Music (BFM)** is a **Vanilla World of Warcraft AddOn** designed to elevate your gameplay by playing dynamic, customized music during boss encounters. Built with the **Turtle WoW API**, BFM aims to seamlessly detect the start and end of boss fights, transitioning your in-game audio to a thrilling combat soundtrack.

*Please note: This AddOn is currently in active development. While core detection is in place, music playback and full functionality are planned for future updates.*

## âœ¨ Current Features (Development Version)

This current development build focuses on robust boss detection and debugging within the Vanilla WoW environment.

### âž• Implemented Functionality:

* **AddOn Load Confirmation:**
    * A chat message (`"bfm successfully loaded"`) confirms when the AddOn has loaded.
    * **Known Issue:** The current load logic (`ADDON_LOADED` AND `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`) is slightly off and prevents this message from firing consistently. This will be addressed in an upcoming fix!
* **Boss Fight Detection:**
    * BFM attempts to identify when you're engaging a **boss**. A "boss" is currently defined by its `UnitClassification` (`"worldboss"`, `"boss"`) or a `UnitLevel` of `-1` (common for bosses displaying `??` as their level).
    * **Combat Start:** A chat message (`"Entering in combat against a boss"`) displays when you enter combat with a recognized boss.
    * **Combat End:** A chat message (`"leave bossfight"`) indicates when you leave a boss encounter.
* **Debugging Messages:**
    * Additional chat messages (`"DEBUG: entering combat"`) provide feedback when you generally enter combat, aiding in development.

## ðŸš€ Upcoming Features

We're excited to bring these features to BFM in future updates:

* **Music Playback Integration:** The heart of BFM â€“ enabling the actual playback of custom or predefined music during boss fights.
* **In-Game Configuration:** User-friendly options to customize music preferences, including specific tracks for different bosses, volume control, and more.
* **Advanced Boss Detection:** Refining detection logic with specific boss unit IDs, instance-based triggers, and other criteria for even greater accuracy.
